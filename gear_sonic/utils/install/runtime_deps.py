"""Auto-install missing optional runtime dependencies on first launch.

Why this exists
---------------

The X2 teleop / dataset-recorder workflow has a couple of optional
dependencies that aren't strictly required for every code path
(``gtts`` for the Quest 3 calibration audio prompts is the main
one). Listing them in ``gear_sonic[data_collection]`` is the right
home for documentation, but we don't want a fresh checkout to fail
silently the first time an operator runs the calibration -- they'd
get the (poorly-supported) ``speechSynthesis`` fallback and conclude
"it doesn't work" before noticing the warning.

So the entry-point scripts call :func:`ensure_runtime_deps` *before*
they touch the calibration / recorder code. The first run pip-installs
the missing wheels into the active interpreter; subsequent runs are
no-ops because the modules are importable.

Design choices
--------------

* **No silent installs by default.** We print exactly what we're about
  to install and into which Python interpreter. Operators have been
  burned by tools that quietly mutate their venv; the verbose log
  here is a feature.
* **Graceful failure.** If pip fails (no network, locked env, etc.)
  the function returns ``False`` instead of raising. The caller then
  decides whether to abort or continue with degraded behavior.
* **Opt-out via env var.** Set ``GEAR_SONIC_NO_AUTO_INSTALL=1`` to
  disable the auto-installer entirely (useful in CI / Docker /
  reproducible-build settings where the env should be locked).
