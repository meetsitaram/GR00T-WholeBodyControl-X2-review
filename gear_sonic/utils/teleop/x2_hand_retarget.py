"""Quest 3 controller / hand-tracking -> X2 OmniHand 10-DOF retargeting.

Two retargeting paths are exposed:

1. Controllers (legacy): a single scalar grasp ratio per side derived
   from the trigger / grip analog axis. All 10 motors lerp uniformly
   between OPEN and CLOSED anchors. Use
   :func:`controller_grasp_ratio` + :func:`grasp_command_from_ratio`.
2. Hand-tracking: per-finger curls in ``[0, 1]`` from the WebXR
   ``XRHand`` 25-joint API, mapped onto each finger's motors
   independently. Use :func:`per_finger_grasp_command_from_curls`.

Both paths share the OPEN / CLOSED anchors below.

The OPEN / CLOSED anchors below are vendored verbatim from
``agitbot-x2-record-and-replay``'s ``constants.py`` (branch
``quest3-bare-hand-control``). Joint order is the firmware-canonical
``HAND_FINGER_NAMES_PER_SIDE``::

    1 thumb_roll   2 thumb_abad   3 thumb_mcp
    4 index_abad   5 index_pip
    6 middle_pip
    7 ring_abad    8 ring_pip
    9 pinky_abad  10 pinky_pip

Asymmetric per side because the abad ranges are mirrored on left vs
right.

# ── Quest 3 hand-prior coupling compensation ─────────────────────────────
#
# Quest 3's XRHand hand-pose estimator has a strong "fingers move
# together" prior that under-reports per-finger curls when the
# operator curls a single finger in isolation. Cross-correlation
# analysis on data/lerobot/x2_quest3_kinematic_v3/debug/teleop_episode_000000.npz
# (666 hand-mode frames):
#
#   * Pairwise correlations of +0.99-+1.00 between
#     index/middle/ring/pinky curls -- the four fingers effectively
#     move as a single unit in Quest 3's reported joints.
#   * "Isolated curl" probe: when 4 of 5 fingers are <= 0.30, the
#     5th finger NEVER reaches >= 0.30 either; max observed was
#     ~0.29 for index/middle/pinky and ~0.30 for ring (4 frames).
#   * Full fist (all fingers >= 0.8): per-finger curls cap at
#     0.91-0.95, never 1.0.
#
# **Default live behaviour (teleop / dataset recording)** is *linear*
# full-range mapping: each finger's normalised Quest curl in ``[0,
# 1]`` drives the linear interpolation ratio between the OmniHand
# OPEN and CLOSED anchors for that finger's motors -- i.e. the full
# hardware span of each robot finger joint tracks the full reported
# span of the headset finger curl channel. No deadzone and no early
# saturation unless you opt in (see below).
#
# Quest 3's XRHand estimator still has a strong "fingers move
# together" prior: isolated fingers often report well below 1.0 even
# when the operator intends a full close. Operators experience this
# as "the robot's fingers don't fully close when I curl just one
# finger". **Optional** compensation applies a piecewise stretch on
# the raw curl signal (enable with ``apply_curl_compensation=True``):
#
#   * Below DEADZONE (0.25): output 0
#   * Above FULL_THRESHOLD (0.28): output 1.0
#   * Power-curve ease-in in between (gamma = 3.0)
#
# These defaults are NOT hand-picked -- they were chosen by
# sweeping (deadzone, full_threshold, gamma) per finger over a
# grid and picking the combination that maximised the bimodality
# of the post-stretch motor-command distribution on real recorded
# teleop data, pooled across 4 v3 debug episodes (7626 hand-mode
# frames total). See gear_sonic/scripts/tune_finger_curl_compensation.py.
#
# Empirical raw-curl distribution per finger:
#
#   finger      p10    p25    p50    p75    p90
#   thumb     0.26   0.31   0.43   0.72   0.89
#   index     0.11   0.16   0.26   0.70   0.84
#   middle    0.11   0.15   0.28   0.76   0.87
#   ring      0.09   0.15   0.28   0.75   0.85
#   pinky     0.12   0.15   0.25   0.73   0.84
#
# The thumb's rest distribution is shifted ~0.10-0.15 higher than
# the four fingers because (a) Quest3's MAX_CURL_ANGLE.thumb = 90 deg
# vs MAX_CURL_ANGLE.fingers = 180 deg amplifies small thumb bends,
# and (b) anatomically the thumb at "open hand" rest already has
# moderate MCP flexion (~30 deg). So a single global deadzone is
# either too tight for the thumb (passes resting thumb noise as
# closure) or too loose for the fingers (misses moderate
# intentional curls). Per-finger params solve both.
#
# Selected per-finger parameters (single global gamma=5 is fine):
#
#   thumb:                 dz=0.25, full=0.27, gamma=5  (98% bimodal)
#   index/middle/ring/pinky: dz=0.35, full=0.40, gamma=5  (99% bimodal)
#
# Response curve interpretation (via the per-finger gates):
#   thumb raw  in [0.00, 0.25]  ->  output = 0
#   thumb raw  in (0.25, 0.27)  ->  output = (t)**5 (tiny ramp)
#   thumb raw  in [0.27, 1.00]  ->  output = 1
#   finger raw in [0.00, 0.35]  ->  output = 0
#   finger raw in (0.35, 0.40)  ->  output = (t)**5 (tiny ramp)
#   finger raw in [0.40, 1.00]  ->  output = 1
#
# Cost: dynamic range above each finger's full_threshold is
# collapsed -- a partial fist of any kind produces the same motor
# command as a full fist. In practice operators care about the
# full-open and full-closed end-points; intermediate values are
# mostly lost to Quest 3's hand-prior coupling already (pairwise
# finger-curl correlations of +0.99-+1.00 between
# index/middle/ring/pinky). Pass ``apply_curl_compensation=True``
# (and tune :func:`stretch_finger_curls` kwargs) when you want that
# behaviour; leave it at the default ``False`` for proportional,
# full-span tracking.
#
# Backwards-compat scalar defaults: when callers pass a single
# float, the global value is used for all five fingers. The
# scalar defaults below are the per-finger fallback that
# corresponds to the thumb (the most permissive of the two
# settings) so that legacy code that doesn't differentiate

# ── Thumb-opposition signal stretch ─────────────────────────────────────
#
# The JS-side ``computeThumbOpposition`` (in
# gear_sonic/utils/teleop/vr/quest3_webxr_app/index.html) returns a
# scalar in [0, 1] from a thumb-tip-to-nearest-fingertip distance
# normalised by palm width. The mapping is linear:
#
#   oppose = (0.45 - d_norm) / (0.45 - 0.06)
#
# clamped to [0, 1], where d_norm < 0.06 = "touch" (saturate) and
# d_norm > 0.45 = "far apart" (zero).
#
# At the operator's natural "relaxed open hand" pose the thumb tip
# sits ~3-4 cm from the index fingertip and the palm width is
# ~8-9 cm, so d_norm ~ 0.35-0.45 and the JS-side signal drifts
# around 0.05-0.25 even though the operator's intent is "no
# opposition". Without a stretch this produces 5-25 % spurious
# closure on thumb_roll / thumb_abad at rest, which the operator
# perceives as "the robot's thumb starts moving by itself".
#
# We apply the same piecewise-power-curve stretch as for finger
# curls. Empirically the JS signal saturates near 1.0 for any
# clear thumb-finger touch (d_norm < 0.10), and rest-bleed sits
# below ~0.25, so a conservative deadzone of 0.25 with a tight
# active zone gives near-binary opposition behaviour matching the
# rest of the pipeline. By default live teleop uses linear opposition
# (``apply_oppose_compensation=False``); set ``True`` to use this

# Linear-mapping the raw curl directly to the OPEN→CLOSED motor
# lerp leaves the operator's "fully open hand" with up to 20 %
# of the thumb pre-closed and the operator's "full fist" with
# up to 15 % of each finger never reaching the CLOSED anchor.
# This is the systematic bias the user described as
# "robot's hand never fully opens AND never fully closes".
#
# The fix is per-operator, per-finger, per-side range
# normalisation: estimate ``(floor, ceiling)`` from a recorded
# session (or from a brief "hold open / make a fist" calibration
# pose pair) and remap the raw curl into ``[0, 1]`` before the
# motor lerp:
#
#     ratio = clip((raw - floor) / (ceiling - floor), 0, 1)
#     cmd   = lerp(open_anchor, closed_anchor, ratio)
#
# This is a strict superset of the linear baseline (set
# ``floor = 0`` and ``ceiling = 1`` to recover it) and stacks
# cleanly with the optional ``stretch_finger_curls`` shaping by
# applying normalisation FIRST then the stretch on the normalised
# value. The stretch is now off by default; the normaliser is the
# recommended way to fix the open/close gap.
#
# Defaults (population-level priors derived from the v4 recording):
#
#   * thumb floor 0.20, ceiling 0.95 (the thumb sits high at rest;
#     ceiling pulled in to 0.95 to avoid the ~5 % saturation gap
#     past p95).
#   * other fingers floor 0.10, ceiling 0.85 (rest noise floor +
#     "fingers move together" ceiling).
#
# These match the v4 distribution closely but are NOT a substitute
# for per-operator calibration -- they're a sensible fall-back when

    independent thumb-opposition signal driving the thumb motors
    AND an optional per-finger thumb-tip-to-fingertip proximity
    signal driving the four non-thumb fingers.

    The five finger-curl values come from XRHand chain bends and
    capture per-finger flexion well, but two anatomical motions are
    poorly captured by the chain alone:

    * The thumb's CMC opposition (swinging the thumb across the
      palm) is not in the XRHand chain, so the thumb-curl signal
      barely moves on a thumb-finger touch even when the operator's
      thumb is fully opposed. This is fixed by the WebXR client's
      ``computeThumbOpposition`` scalar (see ``index.html``), which
      is fed in as ``thumb_oppose`` and drives all three thumb
      motors via ``max(thumb_oppose, thumb_flex_curl)``.

    * Symmetrically, the OmniHand's non-thumb fingers each have one
      active flexion DOF (``*_pip``) cascading two mimic-coupled
      segments, but the operator's finger has THREE knuckles
      (MCP+PIP+DIP) summing to a much larger total bend. Even after
      per-operator curl normalisation the receiving finger only
      travels ~36 % to CLOSED on a deliberate thumb-finger touch
      because Quest 3's "fingers move together" prior caps isolated
      single-finger curls at ~0.30-0.40 raw. The
      ``finger_tip_oppose`` 4-vector (one entry per non-thumb
      finger, from the WebXR client's ``computeFingerTipOppose``)
      saturates at literal contact (d_norm < 0.06 ≈ 0.5 cm) and
      drives each ``*_pip`` (and the matching ``*_abad`` for index
      / ring / pinky) via ``max(curls[i], finger_tip_oppose[i])``.
      During non-touch frames the proximity signal is near zero
      and ``max`` reduces to the curl, preserving smooth
      proportional control.

        finger_tip_oppose: ``(4,)`` array in ``[0, 1]`` ordered
            ``[index, middle, ring, pinky]`` -- per-finger
            thumb-tip proximity (saturates at touch, ~0 when far).
