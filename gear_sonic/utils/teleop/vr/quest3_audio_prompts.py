"""Pre-recorded audio prompts for the Quest 3 calibration overlay.

Why this module exists
----------------------

The Quest 3 Browser has a flaky ``speechSynthesis`` implementation: TTS
needs to be primed inside a user gesture (``Start VR`` click), the
priming sometimes lapses when the immersive-ar session takes over the
audio focus, and on some headsets it never emits any sound at all even
though the engine reports success. We can't ship a calibration UX that
"hopefully" speaks.

Workaround: ship pre-rendered MP3 files for each calibration prompt and
play them from the WebXR client via a regular ``<audio>`` element.
``<audio>`` playback is robust in immersive-ar because it doesn't
depend on the speech engine -- it routes through the same audio path
as YouTube, Spotify, etc., which the headset always plumbs through to
the speakers.

The MP3 files are generated on-demand using gTTS (the only Python TTS
package that doesn't depend on system services) and cached in
``gear_sonic/utils/teleop/vr/quest3_webxr_app/audio/``. They are
generated lazily by :func:`ensure_prompt_audio_files` -- the
:class:`Quest3Reader` calls it on startup so first-run users get them
without an extra step.

Voice / language choices are intentional defaults; expose them on the
generator if you ever need a different voice for accessibility.
