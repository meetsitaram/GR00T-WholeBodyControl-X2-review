"""Edge-triggered button + chord state machine for VR controllers.

Both the G1 manager (`quest3_manager_thread_server.py`) and the X2 manager
(`quest3_manager_x2.py`) need rising-edge detection on the four face buttons
plus a small set of chord combinations (A+B, X+Y, A+X, B+Y, A+B+X+Y).

This module owns the previous-state bookkeeping so each manager only has
to feed in the current-tick boolean tuple and read the events out.

Behavior is preserved bit-for-bit from the original inline state machines
in `Quest3PlannerStreamer.run_once()` (lines ~115-138) and the manager
loop (lines ~344-407) of the original G1 manager script. Each manager
constructs its own `ButtonStateMachine` instance, so per-button log
messages still appear once per tracking site (preserving the existing
double-log when the streamer and manager loop both observe the same
press; downstream tools rely on the log lines.)

Usage::

    sm = ButtonStateMachine(log_prefix="Manager")
    while True:
        a, b, x, y = reader.get_buttons()
        ev = sm.tick(a, b, x, y)
        if ev.abxy_pressed:
            ...  # start / stop chord
        if ev.ax_pressed:
            ...  # toggle PLANNER <-> PLANNER_VR_3PT
