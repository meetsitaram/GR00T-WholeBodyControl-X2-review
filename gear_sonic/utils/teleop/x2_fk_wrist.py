"""Forward-kinematics helpers for X2 wrist trajectories from body_q_mj.

Centralises the small but non-trivial FK code that turns a series of
31-D MuJoCo-ordered body joint poses (``action.body_q_mj`` in the
recorded LeRobot datasets, or the bridge's wire) into pelvis-frame
wrist xyz trajectories.

Pelvis-frame means we hold the root freejoint at the world origin with
identity orientation, so the resulting wrist positions reflect *pure
arm + waist motion*. Base drift / walking is excluded by construction.
This is the right frame for:

  * comparing demonstrations to inference (visually & numerically),
  * phase / cycle segmentation (locomotion noise doesn't leak into
    "is the wrist near the table?"),
  * raw-policy-intent vs. delivered-wire diagnostics on chunk dumps.

Originally lived inside
``gear_sonic/scripts/view_x2_recorded_dataset.py``; extracted so other
analysis tools (segmentation pipeline, diagnostic CLIs, future replay
tooling) can reuse the same code path without copy-pasting joint name
tables.

The functions intentionally return ``None`` instead of raising when
MuJoCo or the MJCF can't be loaded, so callers can degrade gracefully
to scalar-only fallbacks (the viewer does this already).

    Parameters
    ----------
    body_q_mj_series
        ``(N, >=31)`` array of MuJoCo-ordered body joints. Only the
        first 31 columns are used. Dtype is coerced to float64 inside.
    mjcf_path
        MJCF to load. Defaults to ``data/assets/robot_description/mjcf/
        x2_ultra.xml`` shipped with the repo.
    body_names
        Body names to read after each FK step. Bodies missing from the
        MJCF are skipped with a warning rather than raising; if NO body
        survives, returns ``None``.
    verbose
        When True, prints a one-line FK-done summary with per-axis
        ranges for each tracked body.
    log_prefix
        Prefix attached to all info / warning prints (e.g. ``"[view]"``
        for the rerun viewer, ``"[segment]"`` for the segmentation
        pipeline).

    Returns
    -------
    dict[body_name, (N, 3) float64] | None
        Pelvis-frame wrist positions. ``None`` if MuJoCo can't be
        imported, the MJCF can't be loaded, the MJCF lacks any of the
        expected body joints, or no tracked body is present in the MJCF

        degrade gracefully without retrying.
