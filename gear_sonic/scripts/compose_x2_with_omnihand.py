"""Compose the X2 Ultra MJCF with two articulated OmniHand-2025 chains.

This module exists purely to support **rendering and inspection videos**. The
production training MJCF (``gear_sonic/data/assets/robot_description/mjcf/
x2_ultra.xml``) deliberately ends each arm at ``*_wrist_roll_link`` -- 31 DOFs
total -- to match the SONIC tracking decoder, the deploy ONNX, and the AimDK
ROS 2 HAL contract. Hand commands flow out-of-band via ``/aima/hal/joint/hand/
command`` on the real robot.

When we want to *visually* render what those hand commands would have produced
kinematically (for the M3 inspection video, for the M5 camera-plumbing
pipeline that bakes camera frames into the LeRobot dataset, etc.), we compose
the X2 spec with two ``omnihand_{left,right}.urdf`` chains and recreate the
six URDF ``<mimic>`` relationships per side as MJCF ``<equality joint>``
constraints (URDF mimic semantics are not preserved by MuJoCo's URDF parser).

The composition is performed entirely in memory through ``mujoco.MjSpec``;
no static composite XML file is written to disk. This keeps the renderer
asset path stable and avoids divergence between the body MJCF and the
augmented MJCF.

Public entry points
-------------------

``build_x2_with_omnihand_spec``
    Returns a compiled ``MjSpec`` with both hand chains attached.

``HAND_QPOS_LAYOUT``
    Static description of where each side's active / passive hand qpos slots
    end up in the augmented model, plus the prefix that ``MjSpec.attach``
    applies to joint names.

``apply_active_hand_qpos``
    Helper that writes a 10-DOF (per side) active-joint vector into
    ``data.qpos``. The MJCF equality constraints then snap the 6 passive
    DOFs into place on the next ``mj_forward`` call. Use this from the
    *kinematic* (``mj_forward``-only) renderer paths -- it bypasses
    actuator dynamics by stamping qpos directly.

``apply_active_hand_ctrl``
    Helper that writes a 10-DOF (per side) active-joint vector into
    ``data.ctrl``, targeting the position actuators added by
    :func:`_add_finger_actuators`. Use this from the *dynamic*
    (``mj_step``) bridge / sim paths -- the actuators produce smooth
    PD-tracking torques during integration, the equality constraints
    enforce passive = multiplier × active continuously, and there are
    no qpos discontinuities for MuJoCo's integrator to differentiate
    into spurious velocities.

The 10 active joints per side, in order, match exactly:

- ``OMNIHAND_FINGER_NAMES_PER_SIDE`` in
  ``gear_sonic/data/robot_model/supplemental_info/x2_ultra/x2_ultra_supplemental_info.py``
- The motor index order in the AgiBot OmniHand-2025 SDK Python API
- The 10-D layout of ``action.left_hand_joints`` / ``action.right_hand_joints``
  in our LeRobot v2.1 datasets.

# ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


# Mount transforms tuned against the X2 wrist_roll mesh extents (see
# ``gear_sonic/data/assets/robot_description/urdf/x2_ultra/meshes/`` STL bbox
# probe -- the wrist_roll mesh extends from z=0 down to z≈-0.182m in the body
# local frame, i.e. the wrist tip points along -Z).  The OmniHand palm has its
# origin at the cuff-mounting cylinder with fingers extending along +Z. So the
# palm origin should land at z=-0.182m in the wrist_roll body frame, with the
# palm rotated 180° about the local Y axis so its +Z aligns with the wrist's
# -Z (and the SDK's "thumb-out" Y direction is preserved across hands).
#
# These defaults are visual-only; the renderer accepts overrides via
# ``mount_offset_z`` / extra rotation knobs. Tune by re-rendering the
# ego-view inspection video.

# Mount rotation: per-side composition of two rotations applied in body-
# frame order.
#
# Step 1 (BOTH sides): 180° about wrist_roll local Y. This flips the
# OmniHand palm's +Z (fingertip direction) from wrist +Z to wrist -Z
# (away from the elbow), so fingers extend along the forearm.
#
# Step 2: roll about wrist_roll local Z (the wrist long axis). The X2
# left and right wrist_roll bodies are mirrored about the body
# centerline -- so the SAME world-frame "palm down" orientation
# corresponds to OPPOSITE local-Z rolls on the two sides:
#
# * Right wrist (``_RIGHT_MOUNT_QUAT_WXYZ``): +90° about local Z.
#   With the SDK's right palm placing thumb at palm +Y, this swings
#   the thumb to wrist +X (the right wrist's medial side toward the
#   body centerline) and leaves the back of the hand facing up
#   (palm-down).
#
# * Left wrist (``_LEFT_MOUNT_QUAT_WXYZ``): -90° about local Z.
#   The SDK's left palm places thumb at palm -Y (mirrored from the
#   right). The -90° roll swings the thumb to the LEFT wrist's medial
#   side too, and -- crucially -- inverts the palm-up that the right-
#   wrist roll would otherwise produce on the mirrored body.
#
# Without the sign flip, both hands look anatomically correct
# *individually*, but the left palm faces up while the right palm
# faces down, which breaks the piano-down posture rubric.
#

# ── Finger inertial stabilization (armature + passive damping) ─────────
#
# The OmniHand URDF link inertias are extremely small -- the PIP segments
# are ~1.2e-5 kg·m^2 and the DIP segments are ~1.5e-6 kg·m^2 (lighter
# than a paper clip). With the soft mimic equality solver
# (``solimp[0] = 0.9`` by default in MuJoCo) injecting tiny but non-zero
# constraint forces every step at 1 kHz, and no passive damping at the
# joint level to absorb that energy, the integrator turns those forces
# into >70° of finger-joint drift in 5 seconds even when the position
# actuators are commanded to *hold* the rest pose. The fingers visually
# wiggle nonstop in the SONIC bridge sim (``mj_step`` path), while the
# kinematic renderer (``mj_forward`` only, no integration) looks fine.
#
# The fix is purely numerical, not physical: add a small ``armature``
# (rotor inertia at the joint) and a small passive ``damping`` to every
# OmniHand finger joint. Armature inflates the diagonal of the mass
# matrix without changing the link inertia (so pose / FK / contacts are
# unchanged), making the joints insensitive to small constraint impulses.
# Passive damping bleeds off any residual oscillation between actuator
# updates.
#
# Sweep results (5 s of mj_step with ctrl frozen at rest pose, max over
# all 32 non-locked finger joints; see PR diagnosis for the script):

#
# armature alone gives a 90× drift / 260× jitter improvement; adding a
# small passive damping further smooths the residual oscillation to
# < 0.1° per second of drift. Higher armature (1e-2) trades 1° more
# steady-state drift for marginally less jitter -- not worth it.
#
# Tracking response with these values: at kp=20, the closed-loop time
# constant is ~50 ms (well under the bridge's 1 kHz integration step
# and indistinguishable at the 50 Hz teleop command rate). Human finger
# motion lives at < 5 Hz, so the operator will not perceive the added
# inertia; the SONIC body policy never sees these joints anyway.

    The augmented MJCF has equality constraints for the 6 mimic relationships

    drove fingers by stamping ``mj_data.qpos`` directly and calling
    ``mj_forward``.

    That kinematic strategy explodes under ``mj_step`` (the SONIC C++
    deploy bridge's hot path): each step writes new qpos, MuJoCo's
    integrator differences it into a huge implicit qvel, the equality
    solver fights to enforce passive=mult×active against those
    infinities, and a finger DOF goes QACC NaN within 0.5s of sim time.

    Position actuators close that loop properly: the bridge writes
    setpoints to ``mj_data.ctrl[active_actadr]``, MuJoCo's integrator
    handles the dynamics smoothly via PD torque
    ``tau = kp*(ctrl - q) - kv*dq``, and the equality constraints
    operate on a continuous trajectory the way they were designed to.
