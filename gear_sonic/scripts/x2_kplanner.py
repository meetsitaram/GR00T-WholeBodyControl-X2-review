"""Neural kinematic planner daemon for AgiBot X2 Ultra.

Streams 31-DOF reference body poses + root quaternion at 50 Hz on the
``body_pose`` (or legacy ``pose``) ZMQ topic, the same wire format as
``x2_heuristic_planner.py`` -- so downstream subscribers (recorder, MuJoCo
viewer, C++ deploy) are protocol-compatible.

Source of motion: a trained MotionBricks stack
(``motionbricks/out/motionbricks_{vqvae,pose,root}_x2/version_1/``). Source
of velocity intent: hard-coded ``INTENT_VELOCITY_MAP`` keyed on ``(intent,
magnitude)`` from the Quest3 / scripted command sources.

Command surface (any combination, mirrors the heuristic daemon's UX):
  - ``--demo PATH.yaml`` : scripted command sequence
  - ``--keyboard``       : interactive keyboard mode (TTY only)
  - ``--zmq-cmd-port``   : ZMQ SUB on ``planner_cmd`` topic for external drive

Architecture (per
``docs/source/references/x2_quest3_planner_stack_architecture.md`` updated
for kplanner):

  - Main thread runs the 50 Hz publish loop (``PosePublisher.publish``),
    pulling one frame per tick out of the ``NeuralPlannerCore`` ring buffer.
  - Worker thread monitors the ring-buffer occupancy. When it drops below
    ``--replan-threshold-frames`` it calls
    ``NeuralPlannerCore.replan_with_velocity(target)`` to refill. ``predict()``
    can take 5--15 ms on GPU; running it in a worker keeps the publish thread
    on its 20 ms tick.
  - The current ``target_local_root_values`` is updated atomically from the
    latest received ``LocomotionCommand`` via ``INTENT_VELOCITY_MAP``.

Run from the repo root::

    .venv/bin/python -m gear_sonic.scripts.x2_kplanner \\
        --body-pose-port 5555 \\
        --zmq-cmd-host 127.0.0.1 --zmq-cmd-port 5557

See ``run_x2_quest3_planner_stack.sh --planner kplanner`` for the integrated
launcher that wires this up with the recorder + deploy + Quest3 stack.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Intent -> velocity dispatcher. The neural model consumes a continuous
# 4-D vector ``(yaw_rate_rad_s, vel_x_m_s, vel_z_m_s, hip_height_m)``.
#
# CHANNEL CONVENTION (verified against the X2 + G1 mujoco converter and
# the LocalRootLocalBody motion-rep, see
# ``motionbricks/scripts/probe_root_constraint_modes.py``):
#
#   * ``vel_x`` = motion-rep X = MuJoCo Y = **lateral** (positive = +X
#     in the motion-rep frame = robot's LEFT after canonicalization).
#   * ``vel_z`` = motion-rep Z = MuJoCo X = **forward** (positive = +Z
#     in the motion-rep frame = robot's FORWARD after canonicalization).
#
# The earlier docstring claim that "vel_z is lateral" was WRONG and the
# original ``_BASE_VELOCITY`` table fed forward speed into vel_x, which
# the model interpreted as a lateral command. Combined with the
# velocity-only target masking in NeuralPlannerCore (now fixed), this
# explains the historical "robot doesn't walk forward" symptom.
#
# Vocabulary contract with ``quest3_manager_x2``: the manager's
# ``IntentDecoder`` was authored for the heuristic planner's curated
# motion bins (``deg_15/30/45/90`` turns, ``quarter_ft / half_ft /
# one_ft`` strides). The kplanner does NOT honour those labels as
# literal angles or distances -- for the neural model they are
# intensity buckets scaling a continuous velocity. To avoid locking
# the kplanner into the heuristic's labels we split the table:
#
#   ``_BASE_VELOCITY``: direction-explicit intent -> 1× velocity vector.
#                       Direction is encoded in the intent name
#                       (``fwd_step`` vs ``back_step``, ``turn_left``
#                       vs ``turn_right``, etc.).
#   ``_TRANSLATIONAL_SCALE`` / ``_TURN_SCALE``: magnitude string ->
#                       scalar multiplier (``default`` = 1.0). Unknown
#                       magnitudes fall back to 1.0 so manager-side
#                       vocabulary additions don't silently idle.
#
# ``INTENT_VELOCITY_MAP`` is derived at import time from the dispatcher
# for docs / debug dumps. The two surfaces are guaranteed to agree
# because they go through the same ``_resolve_velocity()`` path.
#
# Numbers are intentionally conservative on the kinematic side; we can
# raise them once the deploy is verified stable on each direction.

# Minimum forward velocity command (m/s) emitted whenever the operator
# commits any non-zero forward stick deflection in the
# continuous-locomotion path. Default 0.30 m/s lands the SONIC X2
# root model inside its in-distribution forward-walk band as soon as
# the operator pushes past the deadzone. Set to 0.0 to disable the
# floor entirely (pre-2026-05-31 legacy behaviour).
#
# Rationale: ``x2_ultra_locowalk.pkl`` forward-walk training samples
# are concentrated between roughly 0.3 - 1.0 m/s, with essentially no
# coverage below 0.3 m/s. Commanding 0 < vel_z < 0.3 puts the policy
# OOD -- empirically the robot wiggles its hips but never initiates
# a step, then snaps into an unstable stride once vel_z finally
# exceeds the training-band minimum (operator-reported 2026-05-31).
# The backward channel does not need this floor because the same
# corpus has dense backward samples all the way down to ~-0.08 m/s.
#
# 0.30 m/s was picked as the default because it sits just above the
# training-band p1 (~0.28 m/s) -- the smallest forward speed the
# policy has more than a handful of frames of. Operators who want
# more aggressive lift-off (faster, less smooth deadzone transition)
# can bump to ~0.40 m/s; operators who want to revert to raw
# proportional control (and accept the hip-wiggle below ~0.3 m/s)
# can set 0.0.
#
# The floor is applied **post** ``_RUNTIME_FORWARD_SCALE`` in
# ``_apply_continuous_runtime_scales`` so it acts as a true
# operator-felt minimum regardless of any scale override. Operators
# who want progressive forward control above the floor should keep
# ``floor < forward_scale * _WALK_SPEED_MPS`` (i.e.
# ``floor < 0.5 m/s`` at scale=1.0); otherwise every forward stick
# value collapses onto the floor. Tunable via
# ``--continuous-forward-min-mps`` (CLI) or
# ``KPLANNER_CONTINUOUS_FORWARD_MIN_MPS`` (env var on the
# Quest 3 wrapper). The bucketed forward intents and the PKL replay
# path are intentionally untouched -- the floor only fires when the

# Yaw-rate ceiling for the **continuous-locomotion** path (Quest 3

#
#   * The current X2 root model trained on
#     ``Loop_Forward_Walk_001__A018``, which contains essentially zero
#     yaw motion. Any non-zero yaw_rate is extrapolation; the larger
#     the yaw the more OOD the prediction. Empirically full-stick at
#     1.5 rad/s (~86 deg/s = a 90 deg turn in ~1 s) overdrives the
#     model and the operator reports "turns are too aggressive". A
#     90 deg turn in ~2 s (0.75 rad/s, ~43 deg/s) sits comfortably
#     inside what the policy can track.
#   * Bucketed callers (``turn_left / deg_45`` etc.) intentionally
#     want sharp pivots from a single button press -- those continue
#     to use the legacy ``_TURN_*_RAD_S`` table.
#
# Tunable at runtime via ``--continuous-turn-max-rad-s`` on the

# the Quest 3 / PKL wrappers. The per-side ``_RUNTIME_TURN_LEFT_SCALE

# Default hip-height TARGET (channel 3 of the velocity intent the model

# wires it into ``implied_target_y`` (see
# ``motion_backbone/inference/neural_planner.py:414``), so the model
# treats it as the world-frame pelvis Y the predicted gait must drive
# toward.
#
# Must therefore match the **training distribution** of pelvis height.
# The X2 PKL corpus (``x2_ultra_locowalk.pkl``) has pelvis_z spanning
# roughly 0.595 - 0.726 m with a mean around 0.661 m; the working
# PKL-replay sweep (``x2_pkl_command_source --use-mean-intent``)
# computed 0.687 m and produced the only configuration where the
# deploy actually walked (see "Deploy-integration diagnostics" in
# motionbricks/docs/x2_kplanner_evaluation.md).
#
# The historical value (0.95 m, "matches idle_stand") was a stale
# carry-over from an earlier checkpoint whose stand pose sat ~25 cm
# higher than the current ``_TRAINING_DEFAULT_HIP_Z = 0.636 m``.
# Feeding 0.95 to the current model puts the target pelvis ~25 cm
# above any pose in its training distribution; the model produces
# OOD predictions and the policy can't track them, presenting to the
# operator as "robot won't walk forward even on full stick". This
# was the dominant failure mode on the Quest 3 stack before
# 2026-05-30. PKL replay was insulated because ``direct_velocity``
# carries hip_h verbatim from the clip (0.687 m).
#
# 2026-05-30 PM iteration log:
#   0.687 -> 0.636: dropped to _TRAINING_DEFAULT_HIP_Z after MC scan
#     showed the policy actively extending the legs at idle (knee
#     tgt-def ~-0.45 rad, ankle plantarflexed ~+0.28 rad) producing
#     a visible "stands taller than MC" posture + 1-2 Hz rocking sway.
#     Operator feedback: "height changes, but barely noticeable, and
#     still taller than MC height."
#   0.636 -> 0.55: cheap sensitivity probe. 0.55 m is 45 mm BELOW the
#     PKL training-distribution minimum (0.595), so it's intentionally
#     OOD on the low side. RESULT: stand height did not visibly change
#     -- a 14 cm reduction in implied_target_y produced ~no visible
#     pelvis drop. Conclusion: ``hip_h`` is largely ignored by the
#     policy at idle; the leg-extension / "tall stand" behavior is
#     driven by something else (most likely default_angles drift
#     between the policy's training-time defaults and the C++ deploy
#     binary, an IMU pitch bias, or the policy's learned neutral
#     pose). Investigation pivot: leave ``_HIP_HEIGHT_M`` at the
#     PKL-replay-validated 0.687 (only config where deploy actually
#     walks) and probe ``default_angles`` next.
#   0.55 -> 0.687: revert per operator decision -- back to last
#     known-good before pivoting to default_angles investigation.

    unrecognised intents). Logs a single DEBUG line per miss so missing
    vocabulary additions are visible in the planner log.

    Dispatch order (first match wins):

       hip_h) extracted from the motion clip into the model. This
       isolates the kplanner -> deploy link from the analog-stick
       shaping curve and the operator's per-direction runtime scales.

    2. ``intent == "locomotion"`` paired with ``magnitude ==
       "continuous"`` -> analog Quest3 sticks. Reads ``cmd.stick_fwd /
       cmd.stick_side / cmd.stick_yaw`` and shapes them via
       ``_resolve_locomotion_continuous``. Runtime tuning scalars still
       apply post-shaping so ``--kplanner-forward-scale`` caps both
       bucketed and continuous modes consistently.

class _ColdStartVelocityRamp:
    """Per-channel EWMA velocity ramp to smooth idle -> playing transitions.

    The kplanner's neural root model trains exclusively on steady-state
    walking loops (e.g. ``Loop_Forward_Walk_001__A018``); it never sees
    a static-stand -> walking transition. When the operator's L-stick
    first crosses the deadzone, the state machine fires IDLE_LOOP ->
    PLAYING which:

    1. calls ``planner_core.reset(warm)``, wiping the 4-frame context
       ring buffer and refilling it with 4 identical static-stand
       poses;
    2. forwards the raw operator target (e.g. ``vel_z = +0.5 m/s``)
       to ``replan_with_velocity``.

    ``NeuralPlannerCore`` then builds an implied target position at
    ``current_xy + vel * TARGET_HORIZON_S`` (= ``current_xy + 0.5 *
    2.13 = current_xy + 1.07 m`` in this example), meaning the model is
    asked to project from "4 frames of static stand" to "1 m ahead in
    2.13 s" in a single replan. Because the model has no training
    coverage for that regime, the highest-likelihood prediction
    channel is **pelvis x-translation rather than leg swing**; the
    deploy policy faithfully tracks that and the operator sees
    "torso bends forward, no step". After ~2-4 replans the buffer is
    filled with the model's own (now non-static) predictions and the
    gait stabilises.

    The ramp keeps (yaw_rate, vel_x, vel_z) close to zero for the
    first few replans after PLAYING entry, so the implied target stays
    close to the robot's actual position and the model emits gentler
    forward motion the policy can step into. ``hip_h`` (channel 3) is
    NOT ramped -- it's a posture target, not a velocity, and the
    model needs the correct walking pelvis height from frame 1.

    Time constant defaults to 0.2 s. At a 200 ms replan period
    (``--replan-threshold-frames 2`` + 30 FPS output) that yields
    alpha ~= 0.5, reaching ~95% of the operator's target in ~3
    replans (600 ms). Operators wanting snappier acceleration can
    drop this; ``tau = 0`` disables the ramp entirely (pre-fix
    behaviour).

    Deceleration is handled by the IDLE gate, not by this ramp:
    releasing the stick makes ``intent_to_velocity`` resolve to
    ``_IDLE_INTENT``, the state machine fires PLAYING -> IDLE_LOOP,
    and the publisher freezes the anchor pose immediately. The
    ramper's idle-detection (``last_was_idle``) just makes sure the
    NEXT idle->playing transition starts the ramp from zero again.

    Why this exists
    ---------------

    The deploy publishes a 31-DoF position reference at 50 Hz. The PD law
    closing on each motor is
    ``tau = kp * (target_pos - q) + kd * (target_vel - dq) + effort_ff``,
    evaluated at 500 Hz. When the published ``target_pos`` jumps by
    several degrees in a single 20 ms tick (e.g. operator pushes the
    Quest 3 thumbstick and the kplanner switches its reference source
    from frozen ``default_angles`` to the live neural buffer; same in
    reverse on release), the lower-body kp (hip/knee ~99 Nm/rad,
    ankle ~21 Nm/rad after the 2026-05 stability bump) multiplies that
    step into a torque step on the wire. The motor current loop slams
    current to deliver it, and the real-hardware drivetrain absorbs the
    step as a percussive backlash / bearing snap -- the operator-reported
    "loud click" on every stick push and release. MuJoCo has no
    backlash / bearing-snap model, so the symptom is silent in sim.

    How it works (no FSM coupling)
    ------------------------------

    Every publish tick the caller hands the smoother the would-be
    ``target_q`` (31-vector) and the wall-clock tick time. The smoother:

    1. Computes ``delta_max = max(|target_q[i] - last_published_q[i]|)``
       over the channels in ``blend_indices`` only. Arms / head are
       excluded both from the step detection AND from any blending --
       they pass through byte-equivalent to the input.
    2. If no ramp is currently active AND ``delta_max > trigger_rad``,
       it arms a one-shot ramp: ``source_q = last_published_q.copy()``,
       ``ramp_start_t = t_now``, ``ramp_active = True``. The caller can
       attribute the trigger from the published log line (joint name +
       magnitude) but the smoother itself is intentionally agnostic to
       what produced the step. Operator stick push, stick release,
       primitive switch, future MC-handoff piped through this publisher
       -- all are handled uniformly because the step on the wire is the
       same signal.
    3. If a ramp is active, it computes
       ``alpha = blend_fn(min((t_now - ramp_start_t) / ramp_duration_s, 1.0))``
       where ``blend_fn`` is ``halfcos`` by default (``0.5 * (1 - cos(pi*x))``,
       ``C^1`` smooth at both endpoints). The output on blended channels is
       ``(1 - alpha) * source_q[i] + alpha * target_q[i]``; on excluded
       channels it's ``target_q[i]``. The target is sampled *live* every
       tick so the ramp ends exactly on whatever the publisher would
       have emitted anyway, eliminating a second click at the ramp's
       far end.
    4. When ``t_now - ramp_start_t >= ramp_duration_s``, the ramp clears
       (``ramp_active = False``). Subsequent ticks are passthrough until
       a new step is detected.

    Behaviour invariants tested in
    ``tests/test_x2_kplanner_reference_smoother.py``:

      * ``shape=off`` is byte-equivalent passthrough (no detection, no
        log lines, no state updates beyond ``last_published_q``).
      * ``joints=lower_body`` (default) NEVER modifies indices [15..30]
        even during an active ramp (manipulation-safety invariant).
      * An active ramp does not restart on subsequent large deltas (the
        smoother is one-shot per detected step; it must complete before
        re-arming).
      * Sub-trigger deltas pass through without arming a ramp (steady
        walking does not introduce ongoing lag).

    Hot-path cost is O(31) per tick (one np.abs + np.max on the blended
    slice, one np.where or pre-built mask multiply during ramps). The
    smoother is allocated once at startup and held by reference in the
    publish loop.
