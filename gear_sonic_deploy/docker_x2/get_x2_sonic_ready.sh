#!/usr/bin/env bash
# One-shot bring-up: build the X2 container in REAL-ROBOT mode AND run the
# deploy node in --dry-run, with operator-gated safety prompts the whole way.
# This is the single command the operator on the gantry should need to take
# a freshly-flashed laptop + robot pair from cold to "policy is ticking,
# observation tensor is well-formed, no joint commands are leaving the box."
#
# The script is intentionally chatty -- it prints what it's about to do and
# asks before each step that touches the network, the docker daemon, or the
# robot. Add `--yes` to skip all the operator prompts once you trust the flow.
#
# Pre-conditions on the host (NOT auto-configured -- they require root and we
# want the operator to make the choice explicitly):
#   1. SDK ethernet cable in one of PC2/PC3's rear RJ45 dev ports (PC1 = the
#      compute box that hosts the Environment Manager (EM) HTTP API at
#      10.0.1.40, PC2 = the dev unit at 10.0.1.41 we DDS-discover the robot
#      through, PC3 = the redundant dev unit when fitted).
#   2. Host NIC enp10s0 configured as static 10.0.1.2/24, e.g.:
#        sudo ip addr add 10.0.1.2/24 dev enp10s0
#        sudo ip link set enp10s0 up
#   3. ping 10.0.1.41 succeeds from the host.
#
# Default behavior:
#   1. Host pre-flight: NIC, ping, PC1 Environment Manager (EM) HTTP API,
#      stale container check, --model file resolution.
#   2. docker compose build (no-op if cached).
#   3. Inside the container, layer docker-compose.real.yml (DDS unquarantined,
#      ROS_DOMAIN_ID=0, CycloneDDS pinned to enp10s0) and run:
#        ./gear_sonic_deploy/deploy_x2.sh --dry-run --no-stop-mc <your extra flags>
#      We auto-inject --no-stop-mc so the gantry-held robot stays actively
#      PD-held by Motion Control (MC) for the smoke test (forgetting that
#      flag and watching the robot drop into the gantry straps is exactly
#      the surprise we want to engineer out of the bring-up tool). Pass
#      --stop-mc on the wrapper if you want the legacy "stop MC, run policy
#      with zero stiffness/damping, robot is fully passive" behavior.
#      deploy_x2.sh still owns its own ping + DDS pre-flight and the final
#      "ARE YOU SURE" launch gate.
#
# Required:
#   --model PATH  ONNX checkpoint to load (container-side path). We don't
#                 default this on purpose -- silently picking a stale or
#                 partial checkpoint behind the operator's back is exactly
#                 the bug that's painful to debug at the gantry. Even in
#                 --dry-run the C++ deploy loads the ONNX session at startup
#                 (--dry-run only zeroes the stiffness/damping in the
#                 published joint commands), so the model is non-optional.
#
#                 Two container bind mounts are available for the path:
#                   /workspace/sonic/        -> repo root (this repo)
#                   /workspace/checkpoints/  -> $HOME/x2_cloud_checkpoints
#                 Stage long-lived bring-up checkpoints under
#                 gear_sonic_deploy/models/ (git-ignored via the top-level
#                 `models/` rule) for stable, short paths.
#
# Examples:
#   # Bring-up dry run with the in-repo checkpoint (model is required):
#   ./get_x2_sonic_ready.sh \
#     --model /workspace/sonic/gear_sonic_deploy/models/x2_sonic_16k.onnx
#
#   # Same, but auto-flip from WAIT to CONTROL after 5s instead of waiting
#   # for stdin "go" (fine in --dry-run; do NOT use for first powered run):
#   ./get_x2_sonic_ready.sh \
#     --model /workspace/sonic/gear_sonic_deploy/models/x2_sonic_16k.onnx \
#     --autostart-after 5
#
#   # Use a fresh cloud checkpoint without staging it in-repo first:
#   ./get_x2_sonic_ready.sh \
#     --model /workspace/checkpoints/run-20260420_083925/exported/model_step_016000_g1.onnx
#
#   # Skip all the operator prompts (you've done this many times):
#   ./get_x2_sonic_ready.sh --yes --model ...
#
#   # Drop the safe default and let deploy_x2.sh stop MC (robot goes passive
#   # on the gantry; useful when you want to feel/observe gravity-only
#   # behavior under a zero-torque policy):
#   ./get_x2_sonic_ready.sh --stop-mc --model ...
#
#   # Just drop me into a shell -- I'll drive things by hand:
#   ./get_x2_sonic_ready.sh --shell
#
#   # Live action monitor (run in a SECOND terminal alongside an active
#   # deploy in the FIRST terminal). Subscribes to /aima/hal/joint/*/command
#   # and warns on NaN/Inf, large deviations from the standing pose, big
#   # tick-to-tick jumps, or non-zero stiffness/damping in dry-run.
#   # Anything after --monitor is forwarded to x2_action_monitor.py:
#   ./get_x2_sonic_ready.sh --monitor
#   ./get_x2_sonic_ready.sh --monitor --max-deviation 0.7 --quiet
#
#   # One-shot command (skip the deploy entirely):
