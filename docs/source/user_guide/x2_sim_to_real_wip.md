# X2 Ultra Sim-to-Real WIP — Status & Hand-off Notes

**Branch:** `deploy_sim_to_real`
**Last update:** 2026-05-03
**Owner:** sitaram

This document is the running notebook for the AgiBot X2 Ultra
sim-to-real bring-up. It is intentionally written as a hand-off so the
work can be paused (currently to chase the IsaacLab → MuJoCo sim-sim
gap) and resumed without re-deriving context.

For the per-shift operator checklist see
[`x2_first_real_robot.md`](x2_first_real_robot.md). For architecture
and CLI reference see
[`../references/x2_deployment_code.md`](../references/x2_deployment_code.md).

---

## TL;DR

- ONNX deploy on a real X2 Ultra is **stable and safe** end-to-end:
  yaw-anchored reference, IsaacLab-matched action clip, soft-start
  ramp in, soft-exit ramp out, MC handoff is clean (no red flashing
  light on the last 4 powered runs of `take_a_sip`).
- Active-balance behaviour (push-recovery, dynamic motion) is **not yet
  visible on hardware**. The 16k checkpoint hits the ±20 rad
  `action_clip` ceiling for >90 % of ticks and the
  `--max-target-dev 0.30 rad` clamp throttles the resulting commanded
  delta. Increasing `--max-target-dev` toward IsaacLab's measured peak
  (~1.30 rad on `take_a_sip`) is the next powered-run task.
- Work paused here to fix the **IsaacLab vs MuJoCo sim-sim parity
  gap**. Mismatch in the sim-sim loop is the most likely upstream
  cause of "policy clips at 20 in IsaacLab too" and "deploy is
  numerically stable but visually unresponsive".
- **2026-05-02 update.** Sim-sim parity gap on the C++ deploy side is
  now closed. Two bridge-level bugs were the dominant residual after
  G20 / G21:
  - **G22**: `OnWriter` (500 Hz) was publishing a default-zero
    `latest_cmd_` the moment the FSM hit `CONTROL`, prematurely
    cancelling the bridge's pre-handoff freeze and corrupting the
    first-tick obs by ~15 ms of zero-PD physics evolution.
  - **G23**: bridge IMU was reading `mj_objectVelocity(local).ang`
    instead of `qvel[3:6]`, drifting `base_ang_vel` by 0.02 rad/s.
  After both fixes, `--sim-profile parity` first-tick obs is
  bit-exact against `eval_x2_mujoco_onnx.py --obs-dump`
  (`joint_pos_mj` / `joint_vel_mj` / `tokenizer_obs` / `base_ang_vel`
  all max\|Δ\| = 0.0) and the robot stands cleanly through the 30 s
  gate. See {doc}`sim2sim_mujoco` G22 / G23 for the full write-up.
- **2026-05-03 update.** **First powered walk on the real X2 Ultra.**
  iter-22000 sphere-foot checkpoint tracked the `casual_walk_v1`
  reference (one out-and-back cycle of `Turn_Start_Walk_0090_003`,
  ~13.5 s of locomotion + idle anchors) on a one-way rail gantry. Hip
  yaw tracked at 97 % cmd→state on both legs (±55° foot rotation),
  waist yaw at 98 %, max tilt 18.8° at the turn apex, no fall, no
  RAMP_OUT trip, clean MC handoff with **0.20 s `JOINT_DEFAULT` dwell**
  (down from 1.60 s on the previous gestures run thanks to the
  persistent-client escalator with `GetMcAction` ground-truth). Full
  write-up in

## Open issues / known gaps

### 1. Policy authority is gated by `--max-target-dev`

The 16k checkpoint emits `|action_il|` up to ~33 rad per tick during
`take_a_sip` and the IsaacLab-parity clamp truncates to ±20. Even with
the trained `x2_action_scale[i]`, this can produce target-pos
deltas of O(0.5–1.3 rad) per joint. Today we run with
`--max-target-dev 0.30` for safety, which rejects ≥50 % of those
commands. Next powered run should follow the documented ladder:

```
0.30  (current; pre-flight pose check)
0.50  (mid-range; expect visible arm motion on take_a_sip)
1.00  (close to IsaacLab P95)
1.50  (≥ IsaacLab peak; effectively no clamp on this motion)
```

Run each step at least twice with `--return-seconds 2.0` and a `take_a_sip`
or `eat_hot_dog` motion. Promote to the next step only on a clean
handoff.

### 2. Robot doesn't react to pushes

Even after the action-clip patch, on-gantry pushes don't trigger
anything that looks like active balancing. The IsaacLab trajectory dump
shows the policy *does* react to disturbances in sim. Two suspects:

- **(a)** The deploy still under-reports IMU velocity / contact-related
  obs vs IsaacLab. Re-run `compare_deploy_vs_isaaclab_obs.py` with the
  robot held tilted (not just standing) to check. We have only ever
  diffed the standing-pose dump.
- **(b)** Sim-sim gap (see next section): if the IsaacLab policy is
  actually unhealthy and only "looks fine" because IsaacLab has lower
  effective dynamics, deploy stability won't help.

Don't try to debug (2) further until the sim-sim parity story is
closed.

### 3. `x2_action_monitor.py` shows `max|step|=0.000`

500 Hz writer ZOH + `.3f` print precision rounds legitimate steps to
zero. Cosmetic only — `tick.csv` and `target_pos.csv` are still
correct. There's a TODO comment at the top of
`gear_sonic_deploy/scripts/x2_action_monitor.py` describing the fix
(switch to scientific notation or compute over a 50 Hz decimated view).

### 4. Ctrl-C bypasses `RAMP_OUT`

The new `--return-seconds` ramp only fires on `--max-duration`.
Operator Ctrl-C still calls `rclcpp::shutdown()` immediately because
the default rclcpp signal handler doesn't know about our state
machine. Fix: install a custom SIGINT handler that flips
`state_ -> RAMP_OUT` and lets the executor drain. Low risk, ~30 lines.

### 5. C++ test suite is not wired into colcon

`test_obs_builder` is built standalone via the
`build_offline/` CMake config. Need to register it as a `gtest` target
(or even just an `add_executable` test in a colcon `IfBuildingTests`
block) so `colcon test --packages-select agi_x2_deploy_onnx_ref`
actually runs it.

### 6. `eval_agent_trl.py` wrap is fragile

`dump_isaaclab_trajectory.py` monkey-patches `os._exit` to flush
trajectory data because `eval_agent_trl.py` skips Python's `atexit`.
This is brittle — a future refactor of `eval_agent_trl.py` will silently
disable the dump. Move the trajectory hook into `eval_agent_trl.py`
itself behind a `--dump-trajectory` flag.

---

## Suspected root cause (sim-sim gap)

The strongest signal that the current pipeline has an **upstream**
problem is:

> The IsaacLab `ManagerEnvWrapper` clips actions at ±20 rad during
> training, and our `take_a_sip` rollout sits **at the clip** for
> >90 % of ticks. A healthy policy should not be saturated against the
> training-time safety clamp on the very motion it was trained on.

If MuJoCo sim-sim shows the **same** saturation, the ONNX export or
observation pipeline is wrong even before deploy. If MuJoCo shows
healthy actions, the IsaacLab → ONNX export drops something the
`agi_x2_deploy_onnx_ref` proprioception pipeline depends on.

This is the next thing to chase. Suggested entry points:

1. Run `gear_sonic/scripts/eval_x2_mujoco_onnx.py` on the same 16k
   checkpoint and dump per-tick `|action|`. Compare against
   `dump_isaaclab_trajectory.py` output.
2. Run `gear_sonic_deploy/scripts/compare_isaaclab_vs_mujoco_obs.py`
   for the standing pose. If observation diff > 1e-3 anywhere, fix it
   before continuing.
3. Re-export the ONNX with `gear_sonic_deploy/scripts/reexport_x2_onnx.sh`
   if a per-step parity test against the live PyTorch policy fails.

---

## Resuming this branch

When sim-sim is sorted:

1. Rebase `deploy_sim_to_real` onto whatever branch landed the
   sim-sim fixes (likely `x2-deploy` or a sibling).
2. Re-run the offline parity:
   ```bash
   gear_sonic_deploy/scripts/compare_deploy_vs_isaaclab_obs.py \
     --deploy   logs/x2/obs_dump_idle_yawanchor.bin \
     --isaaclab /tmp/x2_step0_isaaclab_idle.pt \
     --rerun-onnx gear_sonic_deploy/models/x2_sonic_16k.onnx
   ```
   Expect each named slot ≤ 1e-4 from IsaacLab.
3. On-robot smoke test ladder (see `x2_first_real_robot.md`).
4. Walk `--max-target-dev` up the ladder in §1 above.
5. If push-recovery still doesn't appear, schedule a controlled tilt
   test and capture `compare_deploy_vs_isaaclab_obs.py` output for the
   tilted pose (currently we've only ever dumped the standing pose).

---

## Useful commands cheat sheet

### Pre-flight before every powered run

`deploy_x2.sh local` (and `onbot`) now invokes
`gear_sonic_deploy/scripts/x2_preflight.py` automatically as part of
Step 1/4, *before* the MC stop. A failing preflight aborts while MC
is still holding the robot.

Default behaviour (gantry bring-up): all pose / effort violations are
WARN, not FAIL. Tighten for a floor-stand powered run:

```bash
./gear_sonic_deploy/deploy_x2.sh local \
    --preflight-strict \
    --preflight-args "--imu-tilt-deg 12 --max-effort 10" \
    ... rest of args ...
```

Skip entirely (operator override, e.g. you've already run preflight
manually and want to short-circuit a re-run):

```bash
./gear_sonic_deploy/deploy_x2.sh local --no-preflight-py ...
```

### Real-deploy tuning presets (parity-safe)

Real-robot-only post-policy knobs (per-joint clamp, output target LPF) are
captured in YAML presets under
`gear_sonic_deploy/configs/real_deploy_tuning/` and loaded via
`deploy_x2.sh --tuning-config PATH.yaml`. Two presets ship today:

* `conservative.yaml` — first-run validation. Tight `max_target_dev=0.30`,
  no LPF. Use after a new checkpoint or motion playlist.
* `expressive.yaml` — `max_target_dev=0.80` + `target_lpf_hz=8`. Use after
  conservative passes; gives the policy room to track wider arm motions
  while the EMA filter tames leg/waist jitter from real sensor noise.

**Parity rule.** `--tuning-config` is **rejected in sim mode**. Sim
profiles (`parity`, `handoff`, `gantry`, `gantry-dangle`) must keep
talking to the deploy binary with bit-identical CLI flags so
`compare_deploy_vs_python_obs.py` keeps comparing apples to apples.
Architecturally, every knob in a preset that *could* affect the
observation stream lives strictly downstream of the policy: the LPF runs
**after** `ApplySafetyStack`, and `--obs-dump` returns from `OnControl`
before the LPF code path is even reached. Adding a knob here that affects
inputs to the policy must come with an explicit "breaks parity" warning
in `_schema.yaml`. See
`gear_sonic_deploy/configs/real_deploy_tuning/README.md` for the full
contract and the procedure to add a new knob.

```bash
# Conservative — first powered run with iter-N
./gear_sonic_deploy/deploy_x2.sh local \
    --model  ~/x2_cloud_checkpoints/h200-iter-N/model_step_NNN.onnx \
    --motion ./gear_sonic/data/motions/playlists/minimal_v1.yaml \
    --autostart-after 5 --max-duration 5 \
    --tuning-config gear_sonic_deploy/configs/real_deploy_tuning/conservative.yaml \
    --record

# Expressive — once conservative passes, opens up arm range + LPF
./gear_sonic_deploy/deploy_x2.sh local \
    --model  ~/x2_cloud_checkpoints/h200-iter-N/model_step_NNN.onnx \
    --motion ./gear_sonic/data/motions/playlists/standing_gestures_v1.yaml \
    --autostart-after 5 --max-duration 22 \
    --tuning-config gear_sonic_deploy/configs/real_deploy_tuning/expressive.yaml \
    --record
```

### Powered run — current safest settings

The script auto-relaunches inside the `docker_x2/x2sim` container if invoked
from a host shell (no `/workspace/sonic`), mounting `$HOME` at `$HOME` so
all your paths just work. No more manual
`cd docker_x2 && docker compose run --rm --service-ports x2sim bash -lc ...`
incantation. Use `--no-docker` to opt out (requires ROS + aimdk_msgs sourced
on the host).

```bash
./gear_sonic_deploy/deploy_x2.sh local \
    --model  ~/x2_cloud_checkpoints/h200-iter-4000-20260501/model_step_004000.onnx \
    --motion ./gear_sonic/data/motions/playlists/minimal_v1.yaml \
    --autostart-after 5 --max-duration 5 \
    --max-target-dev 0.30 --ramp-seconds 2.0 --tilt-cos -0.3 \
    --return-seconds 2.0 \
    --log-dir /tmp/minv1_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
```

### RAMP_OUT confirmation ladder (3 runs, used 2026-04-27)

Use this exact sequence after any change to the deploy node to verify
soft-exit + MC handoff still works. All three should print
``RAMP_OUT (...s return-to-default)`` then ``RAMP_OUT complete``,
followed by ``[cleanup] MC start_app POSTed.`` with no red flashing
light when MC restarts. Walk a few steps after each run to confirm MC
is happy.

```bash
# Run 1 — repeat of the known-good config (sanity check)
./gear_sonic_deploy/deploy_x2.sh local \
    --model /workspace/sonic/gear_sonic_deploy/models/x2_sonic_16k.onnx \
    --motion /workspace/sonic/gear_sonic_deploy/data/motions_x2m2/x2_ultra_take_a_sip.x2m2 \
    --autostart-after 5 --max-duration 5 \
    --max-target-dev 0.30 --ramp-seconds 2.0 --tilt-cos -0.3 \
    --log-dir /workspace/sonic/logs/x2/takesip_confirm1_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)

# Run 2 — longer in CONTROL so the policy ends up further off-default
#         before RAMP_OUT fires. Stress-tests the lerp distance.
./gear_sonic_deploy/deploy_x2.sh local \
    --model /workspace/sonic/gear_sonic_deploy/models/x2_sonic_16k.onnx \
    --motion /workspace/sonic/gear_sonic_deploy/data/motions_x2m2/x2_ultra_take_a_sip.x2m2 \
    --autostart-after 5 --max-duration 8 \
    --max-target-dev 0.30 --ramp-seconds 2.0 --tilt-cos -0.3 \
    --log-dir /workspace/sonic/logs/x2/takesip_confirm2_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)

# Run 3 — slower return ramp to exercise the lerp at a different speed.
#         3.0 s instead of the default 2.0 s.
./gear_sonic_deploy/deploy_x2.sh local \
    --model /workspace/sonic/gear_sonic_deploy/models/x2_sonic_16k.onnx \
    --motion /workspace/sonic/gear_sonic_deploy/data/motions_x2m2/x2_ultra_take_a_sip.x2m2 \
    --autostart-after 5 --max-duration 5 \
    --max-target-dev 0.30 --ramp-seconds 2.0 --tilt-cos -0.3 --return-seconds 3.0 \
    --log-dir /workspace/sonic/logs/x2/takesip_confirm3_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
```

If any of the three faults, grab the matching
``logs/x2/takesip_confirm*_/tick.csv`` and check the ``ramp_out`` rows:
``target_pos`` should converge linearly to ``default_angles`` within
``return_seconds`` of the ``RAMP_OUT`` warn.

IsaacLab single-step ground truth:

```bash
python gear_sonic/scripts/dump_isaaclab_step0.py \
    +checkpoint=$HOME/x2_cloud_checkpoints/run-20260420_083925 \
    ++dump_path=/tmp/x2_step0_isaaclab_idle.pt
```

IsaacLab full trajectory (500 steps):

```bash
python gear_sonic/scripts/dump_isaaclab_trajectory.py \
    +checkpoint=$HOME/x2_cloud_checkpoints/run-20260420_083925 \
    ++dump_path=/tmp/x2_traj_takesip.pt \
    ++max_render_steps=500
```

Offline unit tests (in container):

```bash
docker exec docker_x2-x2sim-run-... bash -lc '
    source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash &&
    source /ros2_ws/install/setup.bash &&
    source /workspace/sonic/gear_sonic_deploy/install/setup.bash &&

```
